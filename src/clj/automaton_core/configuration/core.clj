;; Options:
;;     See http://realworldclojure.com/application-configuration/
;;     Design decision: outpace is kept as a configuration management tool.
;;     The objectives we have: be able to have local deps, environment dependent, able to get environment variables, with a centralized and controlled values
;;     Outpace is chosen for that, gathering declarations in the same namespace prevent adherance to the lib,
;;     Its configuration file and the namespace allow a centralized definition of the parameters
